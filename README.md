## General Rules to Development
- ***IMPORTANT:*** Please make sure to perform a `git pull` each time before and after you code in order to avoid integration conflicts later on.

- Commit one unit of work each time.

- Each time you pull from the repository, run the tests (when we have them), and run the tests again before you commit.
